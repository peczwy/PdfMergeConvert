# PdfMergeConvert
Repository for my wife - she had to convert a batch of word files to pdf and merge them

## How to use
You'll prolly need to download the repository and compile it. Execute the program with parameter -p (required) which is the path to the folder with .docx.
```
PdfMergeConvert.exe -p [path to docx]
```
In the folder the merged pdf should appear.
